# HPC-MultiGPU-MatrixMult

## Running on a Cluster with SLURM

From the project's root directory, prepare and launch the jobs:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

## Running Locally

```bash
mkdir -p logs csv profiling
mpirun -np <n_process> a.out <matrix_size>
```

Log files will be created in the `logs/` directory:
-   Standard output: `logs/output.log`
-   Errors: `logs/error.log`

CSV files will be generated in the `csv/` directory.

Profiling files generated by NVIDIA Nsight Systems will be saved in the `profiling/` directory:
-   1 file for each MPI process
