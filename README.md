# HPC-MultiGPU-MatrixMult

## Running on [IBiSco](https://ibiscohpc-wiki.scope.unina.it/)

From the project's root directory, prepare and launch the jobs:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

## Running Locally

### Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA Toolkit
- OpenMPI
- NVIDIA Nsight Systems (optional, for profiling)

```bash
mkdir -p logs csv profiling bin
nvcc -I/usr/local/openmpi/include -L/usr/local/openmpi/lib -lmpi -lcublas -lm -arch=sm_89 src/main.cu src/utils.cu src/phpc_matrix_operations.cu -o bin/a.out
mpirun -np <n_process> bin/a.out <matrix_size>
```

> Your gpu architecture may differ. Adjust the `-arch=sm_89` flag accordingly.
> 
> Your system could have installed OpenMPI in a different location. Adjust the `-I` and `-L` flags accordingly.

## Outputs

Log files will be created in the `logs/` directory:
-   Standard output: `logs/output.log`
-   Errors: `logs/error.log`

CSV files will be generated in the `csv/` directory.

Profiling files generated by NVIDIA Nsight Systems will be saved in the `profiling/` directory:
-   1 file for each MPI process
